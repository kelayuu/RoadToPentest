MSFvenom Payload Creator (MSFPC) is a wrapper to generate multiple types of payloads, based on users choice. The idea is to be as **simple as possible** (**only requiring one input**) to produce their payload.

**Fully automating** msfvenom & Metasploit is the end goal _(well as to be be able to automate MSFPC itself)_. The rest is to make the user's life as **easy as possible** (e.g. **IP selection menu**, **msfconsole resource file/commands**, **batch payload production** and able to enter **any argument in any order** _(in various formats/patterns)_).
